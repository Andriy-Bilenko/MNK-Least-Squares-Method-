# MNK (Least-Squares-Method)
## About the program
Was inspired by a linear fit(regression) function in scientific programs like [OriginLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(data_analysis_software)). 
Current program creates a chart with linear approximation for series of experimantal data points (and with data points themselves) from a csv file. 

Program built with Qt 6.5.0 on Windows 11 64-bit, and is designed exlusively for this operating system (though providing the project code it can be built for about any system). With all the dependencies it weights ~60 megabytes. Memory usage - up to 40-50 megabytes. Tested on Windows 10, Windows 11 and Kali Linux (additional private build). Perfomance was tested with valgrind.

## Usage
All the necessary explanations provided in HELP pane in the app itself.
Just install it with fairly easy installation wizard from `MNK_8_0_x64win.exe` and it is ready to do its work.
To uninstall the program open the file browser and find `PATH\WHERE\YOU\INSTALLED\MNK_8_0\uninstall.exe`.

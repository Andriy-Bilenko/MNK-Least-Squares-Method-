# MNK (Least-Squares-Method)
## About the program
Was inspired by a linear fit(regression) function in scientific programs like [OriginLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(data_analysis_software)). 
Current program creates a chart with linear approximation for series of experimantal data points (and with data points themselves) from a text file. File is filled up with data by a user in advance.
Program also shows the data points from the file to the user in a practical text form.

Program built with Qt 6.5.0 on Windows 11 64-bit, and is designed exlusively for this operating system (though providing the project code it can be built for about any system).
With all the dependencies it weights ~50 megabytes.
Memory usage - up to 40-50 megabytes on average, depending on the input data size, how the window is resized and how long app is intended to be used.

## Usage
All the necessary explanations provided in HELP pane in the app itself.
Just install it with fairly easy installation wizard from `MNK_5_0_setup.exe` and it is ready to do its work.
To uninstall the program open the file browser and find `PATH\WHERE\YOU\INSTALLED\MNK_5_0\uninstall.exe`.

## What's new compared to the previous versions
- Full-fledged app compared to one-window app
- Naming axes allowed (along with specifying units)
- has HELP pane with lots of documentation
- now has SKV (dialog for calculating experimental data error)
